# movie-rating-predection
predict a movie rating using AI algortithms

Data files:
1. includes the original data collected from imdb and other sources.
2. includes the data created in the project after doing a lot of proccessing, the created data files have also
new features and more sophisticated data like "actors highest movies ratings average".

Experiments files:
each file do some experiments needed to the regression algorithm to help for deciding the best one, experimnts on 
the parameters and files for choosing most effecient K-features. 
The results calculated as a score which shows the accuracy compared the actual ratings.

Utilities:
algorithms used to build the data and other needed things for the learning stages like splitting data to "test-train" data
and normalize them. includes all the work for building the relevant data for the project.

Scripts:
The most efficient regressor based on a lot of results and statistics and the user input file to use and predict the user movie.
